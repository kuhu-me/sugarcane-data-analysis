# 🌾 Sugarcane Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on global sugarcane production data.  
The aim of the project is to understand patterns related to sugarcane yield, production, acreage, and their variation across countries and continents using visual analysis.

⚠️ **Project Status:** This project is **completed**.  
Please upvote for more such **repositories in future**.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `Data_Analysis.ipynb`  
  Jupyter Notebook containing the complete exploratory data analysis, data processing steps, and visualizations related to sugarcane production.
- `data.csv`  
  Comma Separated values file containing raw and unprocessed data set.  
- `plots`  
  As all the interactive plots cannot be shown in default notebook the interacive plots made with plotly are converted into html files which can easily be launched on your preferre browser giving an ultimate experience.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis 

The following visualizations and analyses have been successfully implemented:

### 1️⃣ Distribution Analysis
To understand the spread, variability, and outliers in the data:
- Violin plot for **Yield (Kg / Hectare)**
- Violin plot for **Acreage (Hectare)**
- Violin plot for **Production per Person (Kg)**
- Violin plot for **Total Production (Tons)**

---

### 2️⃣ Comparative Analysis
To compare sugarcane performance across regions and countries:
- Bar chart showing **Distribution of Countries Across Continents**
- Bar chart for **Average Sugarcane Yield by Continent**
- Bar chart of **Top 10 Sugarcane Producing Countries**

---

### 3️⃣ Relationship & Correlation Analysis
To study relationships between important numerical variables:
- Scatter plot of **Production vs Acreage** (continent-wise comparison)
- Scatter plot of **Yield vs Production per Person**
- **Correlation Heatmap** for numerical features such as yield, production, acreage, and production per person

---

### 4️⃣ Aggregated Continent-Level Insights
To understand global contribution patterns:
- Pie / bar chart showing **Total Sugarcane Production by Continent**
To understand Yield distribution of various countries:
- Box plot shaowing **Yield of Different Continents**

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

## 📌 Notes

- The major focus of the project is **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visulization design**.
- The project mainly focuses on getting to know about the dataset in detail with visulaizations which are interactive and mostly important to get a in-depth understanding of the project.

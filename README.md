# 🌾 Sugarcane Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on global sugarcane production data.  
The aim of the project is to understand patterns related to sugarcane yield, production, acreage, and their variation across countries and continents using visual analysis.

⚠️ **Project Status:** This project is **not completed yet**.  
Further analysis, visualizations, and refinements will be added in **future commits**.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (Completed So Far)

The following visualizations and analyses have been successfully implemented:

### 1️⃣ Distribution Analysis
To understand the spread, variability, and outliers in the data:
- Violin plot for **Yield (Kg / Hectare)**
- Violin plot for **Acreage (Hectare)**
- Violin plot for **Production per Person (Kg)**
- Violin plot for **Total Production (Tons)**

---

### 2️⃣ Comparative Analysis
To compare sugarcane performance across regions and countries:
- Bar chart showing **Distribution of Countries Across Continents**
- Bar chart for **Average Sugarcane Yield by Continent**
- Bar chart of **Top 10 Sugarcane Producing Countries**

---

### 3️⃣ Relationship & Correlation Analysis
To study relationships between important numerical variables:
- Scatter plot of **Production vs Acreage** (continent-wise comparison)
- Scatter plot of **Yield vs Production per Person**
- **Correlation Heatmap** for numerical features such as yield, production, acreage, and production per person

---

### 4️⃣ Aggregated Continent-Level Insights
To understand global contribution patterns:
- Pie / bar chart showing **Total Sugarcane Production by Continent**
To understand Yield distribution of various countries:
- Box plot shaowing **Yield of Different Continents**

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

## 🚧 Ongoing Work & Future Updates

This project is still under development. Planned future updates include:
- Additional exploratory insights
- Improved and more interactive visualizations
- Deeper statistical analysis
- Possible trend-based or predictive analysis
- Better documentation and conclusions

All future improvements will be added through **new commits**.

## 📌 Notes

- The current focus of the project is **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- Visualizations are designed to support analytical understanding rather than prediction.
- The notebook will be updated iteratively as the project progresses.
- Interactive Plotly visualizations may not render in GitHub’s notebook preview. Please run the notebook locally to view them.
